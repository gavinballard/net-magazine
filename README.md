## Introduction
This repository contains the example code for my article for [net magazine][] on
getting started with Shopify theme development.

You can follow along with changes described in the article by looking through the
commits to this repository, as well as viewing the theme in action
[on the demo store][].


## Starting Fresh
It's possible that Shopify's default store theme (currently "Launchpad Star") has
changed since the article's publication. If that's the case, and you're noticing
significant differences between your store's theme code and that presented in the
article, you can upload a copy of the theme as it existed at the time of writing.

To do that, just perform the following steps:
 
1. Download [this zipped version of the old theme][];
2. Open the "Themes" section in your store's administration dashboard;
3. Click "Upload a theme" and upload the .zip;
4. Wait for the theme to upload, then click "Publish theme".


## Importing Demo Products
Developing a theme isn't much fun with some products in your store. Before you
start working through this tutorial, you should open up the "Products" section
in your store's administration dashboard and add a few sample products.

If you're lacking imagination, or just want to get up and running as soon as
possible, you can import a few pre-prepared products by:

1. Downloading [this CSV file][];
2. Open the "Products" section in your store's administration dashboard;
3. Click "Import" at the top of the screen and upload the .csv;
4. Click "Start import", sit back and relax.
